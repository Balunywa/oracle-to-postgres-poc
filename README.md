# Oracle → Azure Database for PostgreSQL — Rapid Migration POC

A **complete, self-contained rapid POC** for converting an Oracle schema to **Azure Database
for PostgreSQL**, deployed by a single **Deploy to Azure** button. One click provisions
everything inside a single virtual network:

- a **Windows workstation** running desktop **Visual Studio Code + the Microsoft PostgreSQL
  extension** (the tool that performs the AI conversion),
- an **Oracle source database** (Oracle Database Free 23ai in a container) pre-seeded with a
  sample **HR** schema — so you can prove the tooling end to end with zero external dependencies,
- an **Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server** as the conversion target, and
- an **Azure OpenAI (Microsoft Foundry)** model deployment that powers the AI conversion.

Everything is network-isolated and reached privately over **Azure Bastion**. No custom
conversion logic runs here — the PostgreSQL extension does the work; this repo just stands
up the whole environment for you.

You can run the POC two ways:

1. **Against the built-in Oracle source** (recommended first) — validates the workstation,
   Bastion access, the PostgreSQL target, and your Azure OpenAI quota with no external
   dependencies, using the pre-seeded HR schema.
2. **Against your own dev/test Oracle** — once the built-in run succeeds, point the wizard at
   a real Oracle database instead. See [Use your own Oracle source](#use-your-own-oracle-source)
   for the prerequisites.

## Deploy to Azure

Click the button, sign in to the Azure portal, fill in the form (admin username and
password, VM sizes, PostgreSQL tier, and model deployment name), and select
**Review + create**. Everything — workstation, Oracle source, PostgreSQL target, and the
Azure OpenAI deployment — is created for you. No CLI required.

After the deployment finishes, see [Connect to the workstation](deploy/azure/DEPLOYMENT.md#connect)
to open the Azure Bastion RDP tunnel and start the Migration Wizard.

## What's installed on the workstation

The workstation is a Windows Server 2022 VM provisioned at deploy time by
[deploy/azure/setup.ps1](deploy/azure/setup.ps1).

**VS Code extensions** (installed at first interactive logon):

| Extension | ID | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL (Microsoft) | `ms-ossdata.vscode-pgsql` | Runs the Migration Wizard and performs the AI schema conversion |
| GitHub Copilot | `github.copilot` | Copilot agent used to triage and fix conversion tasks |
| GitHub Copilot Chat | `github.copilot-chat` | Chat / agent mode for resolving flagged items |

**Command-line tooling** (installed system-wide during deployment):

- **Visual Studio Code** (desktop, added to `PATH`)
- **Oracle Instant Client 21.13** (thick-client mode, on `PATH`) — connects to the Oracle source
- **Azure CLI** — Azure sign-in (`az login`) for working with the deployed resources

> **First-logon note:** the three extensions install via a Windows `RunOnce` entry the first
> time you sign in, so they need outbound access to the VS Code Marketplace at that moment and
> appear a few seconds after the desktop loads. The setup log's `PROVISION_COMPLETE` line is
> written *before* that logon, so it confirms the deploy-time steps finished — not that the
> extensions installed. If any are missing, run the `code --install-extension` commands from
> [deploy/azure/setup.ps1](deploy/azure/setup.ps1) manually in a terminal.

## After deployment: run the schema conversion

The template stands up the whole environment, but the conversion itself is an **interactive**
task you run inside VS Code on the workstation — the Migration Wizard and GitHub Copilot
can't run headlessly. Follow these steps once the deployment finishes.

### 1. Collect your connection values

Every value the wizard asks for is a deployment output. Open the deployment's **Outputs**
in the portal, or run:

```bash
az deployment group show -g oracle-bridge-rg -n <deployment-name> \
  --query properties.outputs -o jsonc
```

| Wizard field | Value | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Oracle host | e.g. `10.42.3.4` | `oraclePrivateIp` |
| Oracle port | `1521` | (fixed) |
| Oracle service name | `FREEPDB1` | `oracleServiceName` |
| Oracle migration user | `MIG` + your deploy password | seeded, read-only |
| PostgreSQL server | e.g. `orabridge-pg-xxxx.postgres.database.azure.com` | `postgresFqdn` |
| PostgreSQL admin | `azureuser` + your deploy password | `postgresAdmin` |
| Foundry endpoint | e.g. `https://orabridge-oai-xxxx.openai.azure.com/` | `foundryEndpoint` |
| Foundry deployment | `gpt-5-mini` | `foundryDeployment` |

The Foundry endpoint and deployment are also set on the workstation as the machine
environment variables `FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT` and `FOUNDRY_DEPLOYMENT`.

### 2. Connect and sign in

1. Open the Bastion RDP tunnel (the `bastionRdpTunnelCommand` output) and RDP to
   `localhost:13389` with your admin username and password.
2. Launch **Visual Studio Code**. On first logon the PostgreSQL extension, GitHub Copilot,
   and Copilot Chat finish installing.
3. Sign in to **GitHub Copilot** and to the **PostgreSQL extension** (Microsoft Entra ID).
   This is the one sign-in the template can't do for you.

### 3. Create the migration project

In the PostgreSQL extension, open the **Migrations (preview)** view → **Create Migration Project**:

1. **Project Setup** — name the project, then **Next**.
2. **Connect to Oracle** — host `oraclePrivateIp`, port `1521`, service `FREEPDB1`, user
   `MIG` with your deploy password. Select **Load Schemas**, choose **HR**, then **Next**.
3. **Scratch database** — connect to the PostgreSQL flexible server (`postgresFqdn`) with
   admin `azureuser` and your deploy password (SSL mode `require`). Pick a target database,
   select **Verify Extensions**, then **Next**.
4. **Microsoft Foundry** — enter `foundryEndpoint` and the **deployment name** `gpt-5-mini`
   (this is the model deployment, not the resource name), and authenticate with the **API key**
   from the Azure OpenAI resource (**Keys and Endpoint**).
5. Select **Test Connection**, then **Create Migration Project**.

### 4. Run the conversion

On the **Schema Migration** card select **Migrate**, watch the *Extracting → Converting*
stages, and wait for **Migration Complete**. Select **View Migration Report**.

### 5. Review, triage, and resolve

1. Read `reports/customer_summary.md` first for the readiness decision, success percentage,
   and the count of **Mandatory** tasks. For a per-object breakdown with DDL snippets, open
   `reports/technical_conversion_report.md`; treat `reports/review_tasks.md` as an offline
   reference and resolve tasks from the Schema Review pane instead.
2. In the **Schema Review** pane, start in the **Grouped** view to scan tasks by behavioral
   category (for example *Numeric Semantics*, *Empty String / NULL*), then switch to the
   **Tasks** view and filter **Status = Pending**, **Priority = Mandatory** to work through
   them one by one.
3. Select **Run Task** to open **GitHub Copilot agent mode** with the source and generated
   DDL loaded. Review the proposed fix, apply it to the `.sql` file under
   `postgres_ddl/<schema>/<object_type>/`, run it against the scratch database to confirm it
   compiles, then select **Resolve**.
4. Independently validate every AI-assisted fix — the success percentage reflects automated
   coverage, not deployment readiness.

### 6. Produce and deploy `deploy.sql`

The consolidated `deploy.sql` under
`artifacts/oracle/_migration/convert/sessions/<session-id>/` creates the target schema in
dependency order. After you fix the root cause of a task, **rerun the conversion** so
`deploy.sql` is regenerated (a change made directly against the scratch database is *not*
propagated), then apply `deploy.sql` to the PostgreSQL server.

> **If "Verify Extensions" fails:** Azure Database for PostgreSQL requires extensions to be
> allow-listed before use. Add the ones your schema needs to the `azure.extensions` server
> parameter (the server's **Server parameters** blade) and retry.
>
> **If "Load Schemas" fails with a permission error on `SYS.ARGUMENT$`:** the migration user
> needs dictionary read access. Connect as a privileged user and run
> `GRANT SELECT ANY DICTIONARY TO MIG;` (new deployments already include this grant).

## Use your own Oracle source

The built-in `oracle-source-vm` exists so you can prove the end-to-end flow with zero external
dependencies. Once that run succeeds, you can point the Migration Wizard at your own
**dev/test** Oracle instead — nothing on the workstation changes (the Oracle Instant Client is
already installed). Before you connect, make sure the following are in place.

> **Recommended:** run the POC once against the built-in Oracle source first. It validates the
> workstation, Bastion access, the PostgreSQL target, and your Azure OpenAI quota — so if
> anything is off, you know it isn't your own database or network.

**1. Network path (workstation → your Oracle on port 1521)**

The `migration-workstation` must be able to reach your Oracle listener on **1521**. Choose one:

- **VNet peering** — peer this deployment's VNet with the VNet hosting your Oracle.
- **Site-to-site VPN or ExpressRoute** — for an on-premises Oracle.
- **Public endpoint** — the workstation has outbound internet, so your Oracle's firewall/NSG can
  instead allow inbound 1521 from the workstation's public IP (`publicFqdn`). Least preferred;
  only for non-sensitive dev/test.

**2. A read-only migration login**

Create a login for the wizard with the same privileges the built-in `MIG` user gets:

```sql
CREATE USER MIG IDENTIFIED BY "<strong-password>";
GRANT CREATE SESSION        TO MIG;
GRANT SELECT ANY DICTIONARY TO MIG;   -- covers SYS.ARGUMENT$ etc. the wizard reads
GRANT SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE    TO MIG;
GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE       TO MIG;   -- or grant SELECT only on the schemas you convert
```

The conversion **only reads** the source — it never writes to your Oracle — so it is safe to run
against dev/test.

**3. The correct connect identifier**

Use the **service name** of the pluggable database (PDB) you want to convert — not the CDB root
— along with the host and port 1521. A wrong service name is the most common connection failure.

**4. TLS/wallet (only if your Oracle enforces TCPS)**

The default path assumes plain TCP on 1521. If your Oracle requires encrypted connections
(TCPS), supply the wallet/certificate to the Oracle Instant Client on the workstation.

Everything else in the workflow above is identical — just enter your Oracle's host, port, service
name, and the migration-user credentials at the **Connect to Oracle** step.

## Tear down

When you're done, remove everything by deleting the resource group. Azure has no native
one-click *delete* URL (by design), so this button opens the **Resource groups** blade in
the portal — pick the POC's resource group (for example `oracle-bridge-rg`) and choose
**Delete resource group**:

[![Delete resources](https://img.shields.io/badge/Delete-resource%20group-critical?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoftazure&logoColor=white)](https://portal.azure.com/#browse/resourcegroups)

Or run the teardown script (deletes the group and purges the soft-deleted Azure OpenAI
account so its name is freed):

```bash
./deploy/azure/teardown.sh oracle-bridge-rg
```

Equivalent one-liner:

```bash
az group delete -n oracle-bridge-rg --yes
```

## Deploy from the command line (optional)

If you prefer the CLI over the portal button:

```bash
az group create -n oracle-bridge-rg -l westeurope

az deployment group create -g oracle-bridge-rg -f deploy/azure/main.bicep \
  -p adminUsername=azureuser \
     adminPassword='<strong-password>'
```

The admin username and password are reused for the workstation RDP login and for the
Oracle and PostgreSQL admin accounts. The template also creates an Azure OpenAI model
deployment (default `gpt-5-mini`) and grants the workstation's managed identity the
**Cognitive Services OpenAI User** role — so the deploying identity needs permission to
create role assignments (**Owner** or **User Access Administrator** on the resource group).

> If the deployment fails preflight with a `QuotaExceeded` error for a VM family, your
> subscription has no quota for that size in the region. Run `az vm list-usage -l <region>`
> and pass a size you do have, for example `-p vmSize=Standard_D4s_v3` (workstation) or
> `-p oracleVmSize=Standard_D2s_v3` (Oracle source). If the OpenAI deployment fails with
> a model-deprecation error, pass a currently available model, for example
> `-p openAiModelName=gpt-5-mini openAiModelVersion=2025-08-07`.

The deployment outputs `publicFqdn`, `vmResourceId`, `bastionRdpTunnelCommand`,
`oraclePrivateIp`, `oracleServiceName`, `postgresFqdn`, `postgresAdmin`, `foundryEndpoint`,
and `foundryDeployment`. Access is **RDP only, via an Azure Bastion tunnel** — no SSH, no
public RDP port, no public web ports. Open the tunnel, RDP to `localhost:13389` with the
password you set, then use VS Code. Reset the password later via `az vm run-command`.

See [deploy/azure/DEPLOYMENT.md](deploy/azure/DEPLOYMENT.md) for prerequisites, connection
steps, the in-editor workflow, security notes, and tear-down.

## Security

- RDP only, via an Azure Bastion tunnel — no SSH, no public RDP port; RDP (3389) is reachable only from the virtual network.
- The Oracle source (1521) and the PostgreSQL flexible server are reachable **only from within the virtual network** — no public database endpoints. PostgreSQL uses private access with a private DNS zone.
- No public web ports.
- The login password is a `@secure()` deploy-time parameter (not stored in the template) and can be rotated with `az vm run-command`. It is reused for the Oracle and PostgreSQL admin accounts for POC convenience — change them for anything beyond a POC.
- The workstation uses a system-assigned managed identity, granted only the **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** role on the lab's Azure OpenAI account.
- Independently validate all converted objects before deploying to production.
